## Overview

HTML code describes the UI of a webpage. Here's an example HTML file with a live preview:

<Example
  title="First HTML page"
  preset="html"
  height={340}
  files={{
    'index.html': `<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>My page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>Welcome!</p>
    <button>This is a button</button>
  </body>
</html>`,
  }}
/>

HTML includes a large set of built-in UI elements, such as `<p>` (paragraph) and `<button>`. We typically customize these by embedding other kinds of code in our HTML: CSS code lets us add custom styles, and JavaScript code lets us add interactivity.

> If you're familiar with XML, then HTML should feel very similar, although it has some unusual special cases.

## Document type

Every HTML file should start with a **document type declaration**, or DOCTYPE for short. The DOCTYPE specifies which _version_ of the HTML language the file uses. The browser looks at this to decide how to parse the rest of the HTML and render the page.

Most HTML features are backwards compatible, but some aren't, so it's important to specify this so that your page renders correctly now and in the future.

## Head

The `<head>` element contains _metadata_ about the page. Elements in the head don't actually show up in the UI, but instead inform the browser how to render the page.

The head may also include references to other resources that the browser should download in order to display the page, such as CSS and JavaScript code.

At minimum, the `<head>` should contain a `<title>` element, which will set the title of the browser window for that page.

## Body

The `<body>` contains a hierarchy of UI elements that the browser renders. In the next section, we'll look at a variety of these elements in more depth.
