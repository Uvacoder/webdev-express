## Pixels

Pixels are convenient because they're always consistent: no matter where a `px` is used, it always means the same thing. However, this means that we can't easily scale _all_ of our font sizes at once in certain contexts (e.g. the user wants to increase the font size) - we have to go through and set a new `px` value anywhere we use `px`.

<Example
  title="Using px"
  preset="html"
  height={440}
  files={{
    'index.html': `<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>My page</title>
    <style>
      h1 {
        font-size: 48px;
      }
      h2 {
        font-size: 36px;
      }
      h3 {
        font-size: 30px;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Heading 1</h1>
    <h2>Heading 2</h2>
    <h3>Heading 3</h3>
  </body>
</html>`,
  }}
/>

## Ems & Rems

The units `em` are relative to the parent's font size, while `rem` are relatively to the root font size (the size set on the `html` element).

<Example
  title="rems"
  preset="html"
  height={440}
  files={{
    'index.html': `<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>My page</title>
    <style>
      html {
        font-size: 24px;
      }
      h1 {
        font-size: 2rem;
      }
      h2 {
        font-size: 1.5rem;
      }
      h3 {
        font-size: 1.17rem;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Heading 1</h1>
    <h2>Heading 2</h2>
    <h3>Heading 3</h3>
  </body>
</html>`,
  }}
/>

### When to use Ems and Rems?

These units are most commonly used for fonts and spacing. We should use them anywhere we may want a large portion of our site to scale up or down.

## Supporting system font size

It's common to set the root font size to a percent, which then is based on the browser-provided default font size. The user may increase or decrease their font size across all their webpages through their system or browser settings, and we can use this approach to respect their preference.

<Example
  title="rems"
  preset="html"
  height={440}
  files={{
    'index.html': `<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>My page</title>
    <style>
      html {
        font-size: 150%;
      }
      h1 {
        font-size: 2rem;
      }
      h2 {
        font-size: 1.5rem;
      }
      h3 {
        font-size: 1.17rem;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Heading 1</h1>
    <h2>Heading 2</h2>
    <h3>Heading 3</h3>
  </body>
</html>`,
  }}
/>
