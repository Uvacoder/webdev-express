import html from '../../../examples/files/html_and_css/portfolio.html'
import css from '../../../examples/files/html_and_css/portfolio._css'

## Example

<Example

/>

## Steps

### Day 1

1. Create a new HTML document with a `<DOCTYPE>` and a `<title>`

   > In VSCode, there's a convenient snippet if you type "!"

2. Create a new CSS file, and use it in your HTML file via a `<link>` element

3. Add a `<main>` content area, centered horizontally on the page

4. Add several sections of content using `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, and `<p>`, with CSS styles

5. Use `<strong>` or `<em>` to style text within a paragraph

6. Add a `<nav>` element at the top of the page with a link to each heading in your `<main>` section

7. Float an `<img>` to the right of your main content (hint: `float: right`)

8. Ensure your HTML is valid using: https://validator.w3.org/

### Day 2

1. Create a `<form>` using `display: flex` for layout

2. Add a text `<input>`, `<select>` menu, and `<textarea>`, each with a `<label>`. Feel free to use other form elements, like checkboxes, radio buttons, etc.

3. `<textarea>`, each with a `<label>`. Feel free to use other form elements, like checkboxes, radio buttons, etc.

4. Support POSTing the form to https://echo-form-body-u6ozq7lkydx0.runkit.sh/ (If you don't get this
   working, don't worry about it)

5. Use `:hover` and `:active` to make your submit
   button <em>fancy</em>, e.g. with fun colors, a shadow, or a
   background image.

6. Use `::before` and/or `::after` to make a <em>fancy</em> list (try replacing the bullets/numbers with something interesting)
   or block quote (with those really big quotes).

7. Set a root font size, and use `<rem>` units for your font sizes (and possibly paddings/margins).

8. Make your UI `<responsive>` in order to support phone and tablet screen sizes. Use at least 2 \*\*@media>` queries.
