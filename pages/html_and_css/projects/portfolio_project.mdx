import portfolio from '../../../examples/files/html_and_css/portfolio.html'

## Example

<Example
  preset="html"
  panes={['player']}
  height={700}
  files={{
    'index.html': portfolio,
  }}
/>

## Steps

### Day 1

1. Create a new **html** document with a **DOCTYPE** and a **title**

2. Add a **main** content area, centered horizontally on the page

3. Add several sections of content using **h1**, **h2**, **h3**, and **p**, with css styles

4. Use **strong** or **em** to style text within a paragraph

5. Add a **nav** element at the top of the page with a link to each heading in your **main** section

6. Float an **img** to the right of your main content

7. Ensure your HTML is valid using: https://validator.w3.org/

### Day 2

1. Create a **form** using `display: flex` for layout

2. Add a text **input**, **select** menu, and

3. **textarea**, each with a **label**. Feel free to use other form elements, like checkboxes, radio buttons, etc.

4. Support POSTing the form to https://echo-form-body-u6ozq7lkydx0.runkit.sh/ (If you don't get this
   working, don't worry about it)

5. Use `:hover` and `:active` to make your submit
   button <em>fancy</em>, e.g. with fun colors, a shadow, or a
   background image.

6. Use `::before` and/or `::after` to make a <em>fancy</em> list (try replacing the bullets/numbers with something interesting)
   or block quote (with those really big quotes).

7. Set a root font size, and use **rem** units for your font sizes (and possibly paddings/margins).

8. Make your UI **responsive** in order to support phone and tablet screen sizes. Use at least 2 **@media** queries.
