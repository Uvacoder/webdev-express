## WAI-ARIA

WAI-ARIA (Web Accessibility Initiative â€“ Accessible Rich Internet Applications) is the specification for accessibility standards on the web. For more detail, see: https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/aria/

This standard added a variety of HTML element attributes to help make our websites more accessible. Many of these attributes have the prefix `aria`, such as `aria-label`. For more detail on the available attributes, see:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Techniques

## Semantic HTML

The best way to make our page accessible is by using "semantic" HTML elements. Instead of using only `div` and `span` elements and styling them with CSS (which is sometimes easier), we should use elements like `img` and `button` where appropriate, and reset their built-in styles as needed.

Semantic elements have built-in behaviors that users already understand, and screenreaders often know how to interpret them without any special `aria` attributes.

## Roles

If we can't use semantic elements for some reason (e.g. we want to design a custom widget, rather than using a built-in one), we should check if there's a built-in `role` we can use. The `role` attribute tells assistive devices what kind of widget an element is, e.g. image, button, checkbox, dropdown, tree, etc.

By providing a `role` and a variety of `aria` attributes, we can usually create something accessible.

### Example: Images

To display an image, we can use an `img` element, or a `div` with a `background-image` set via CSS.

In some ways, the `div` is more flexible and easier to style. We can even make it accessible to screenreaders by adding a `role` and `aria-label`. However, it will still be missing some default browser behavior (right click to save or open in a new tab).

<Example
  title="Accessible images"
  preset="html"
  height={520}
  files={{
    'index.html': `<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>My Title</title>
    <style>
      #dog {
        width: 200px;
        height: 150px;
        background-image: url("https://picsum.photos/id/237/200/150");
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div>
      Img element (try right clicking):
      <img alt="dog" src="https://picsum.photos/id/237/200/150">
    </div>
    <div>
      Div (right click is missing options):
      <div id="dog" role="img" aria-label="dog" />
    </div>
  </body>
</html>`,
  }}
/>

### Example: Links and buttons

<Example
  title="Links and buttons"
  preset="html"
  files={{
    'index.html': `<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>My Title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div>
      Anchor: <a href="https://www.wikipedia.com">Wikipedia</a>
    </div>
    <div>
      <!-- Lose ability to command click, right click, etc -->
      Button: <button>Wikipedia</button>
    </div>
    <div>
      <!-- Lose abililty to focus -->
      Span: <span>Wikipedia</span>
    </div>
    <script>
      document.querySelectorAll('button, span').forEach(element => {
        element.onclick = () => {
          location.href = 'https://www.wikipedia.com'
        }
      })
    </script>
  </body>
</html>`,
  }}
/>
