The browser's built-in developer tools let us inspect the HTML of _any_ webpage. This is extremely useful for debugging our layout and styles.

## Debugging styles

A few common techniques:

- We often add temporary styles to individual elements to see what they would look like
- We check the computed box model diagram to see why the dimensions of an element look a certain way
- We can look up a computed style for an element and then jump to the source CSS file or style tag where it's defined
