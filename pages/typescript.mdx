## Web browsers run JavaScript

JavaScript is the only language that web browsers can run natively.

JavaScript is weakly-typed, so the following code is valid:

<Example
  title="JavaScript"
  preset="javascript"
  width={0}
  code={`// Declare a variable \`foo\` equal to a number
let foo = 42\n
// Assign a string to the same variable
foo = "Hello, world!"`}
/>

## TypeScript to the rescue

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that supports type annotations.

The above code is no longer valid:

<Example
  title="TypeScript"
  preset="typescript"
  width={0}
  code={`// TypeScript infers the type of \`foo\` to be \`number\`
let foo = 42\n
// ...and prevents us from assigning a string!
foo = "Hello, world!"`}
/>

## How TypeScript works

Type annotations are stripped out during a build step.

Because of this, there may be no way to tell the type of your variables at runtime. E.g. in the example below, there's no way to tell that the `rect` object is a `Rectangle` at runtime, since `Rectangle` doesn't exist in the compiled code.

<Example
  title="TypeScript"
  preset="typescript"
  panes={[
    'editor',
    { type: 'transpiler', title: 'Compiled JavaScript' },
    'player',
  ]}
  width={0}
  code={`let foo: number = 42\n
type Rectangle = {
  width: number
  height: number
}\n
let rect: Rectangle = { 
  width: 0, 
  height: 0
}`}
/>
