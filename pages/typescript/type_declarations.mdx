## `type` keyword

Most types are declared with the `type` keyword.

Unlike most languages, _literal values_ can be used as types.

<Example
  title="Declaring types"
  preset="typescript"
  panes={['editor']}
  code={`type A = number\n
type B = 42\n
// primitive types are lowercase - uppercase is something else (rarely what you want)
type C = Number`}
/>

## Type inference

Variables are declared with `let`, and constants are declared with `const`. Note that the inferred types are different.

<Example
  title="Type inference"
  preset="typescript"
  panes={['editor']}
  code={`let a = 42\n
const b = 42`}
/>

## Object types

Objects are used both like like _dictionaries_, with arbitrary fields but values of the same type, and like _structs_, with named fields and values of different types.

Note that this distinction only exists at compile-time. At run-time, all objects are dictionary-like, supporting arbitrary fields and values.

### "Dictionary-like" objects

<Example
  title="Dictionary-like objects"
  preset="typescript"
  width={0}
  code={`type MyObject = { [key: string]: string }\n
let myObject: MyObject = {
  foo: 'hi'
}\n
myObject.bar = 'ok'\n
console.log(myObject)`}
/>

### "Struct-like" objects

These objects have a set of defined property names and values.

Note that type declarations look _a lot_ like literal values, and it's common to accidentally confuse types and values.

<Example
  title="Struct-like objects"
  preset="typescript"
  width={0}
  code={`type MyObject = {
  foo: number
  bar: string
}\n
let myObject: MyObject = {
  foo: 123,
  bar: "hi",
}\n
console.log(myObject)`}
/>

## Classes

These are about the same as Swift in terms of both syntax and semantics.

## Interfaces

These are about the same as Swift protocols.

Note that when defining objects, `type` and `interface` are almost interchangeable - https://microsoft.github.io/TypeScript-New-Handbook/everything/#interface-vs-alias. Using one or the other mostly comes down to personal preference and whatever pattern has been established in the codebase.

<Example
  title="Struct-like objects"
  preset="typescript"
  width={0}
  code={`interface MyInterface {
  foo: string
  bar(n: number): number
}\n
let o: MyInterface = {
  foo: 'hello',
  bar: () => 42
}`}
/>

TypeScript doesn't support default implementations or protocol extensions (without very non-ideomatic prototype extension).

## Unions

We're allowed to make unions out of any types.

<Example
  title="Unions of constant types"
  preset="typescript"
  width={0}
  code={`type MyUnion = 'apple' | 'cherry' | 'orange' | 'peach' | 'pear'\n
let m: MyUnion = 'apple'`}
/>

### Discriminated Unions

These are analogous to Swift's enums with associated data.

Note that we typically use the property `type` as the "discriminant", but we can use any arbitrary type.

<Example
  title="Unions of constant types"
  preset="typescript"
  width={0}
  code={`type MyUnion =
  | { type: 'mouseEvent'; button: 'left' | 'right' }
  | { type: 'touchEvent'; numberOfTouches: number }
  | { type: 'keyboardEvent'; key: string }\n
function handleEvent(event: MyUnion) {
  switch (event.type) {
    case 'mouseEvent':
      console.log(event.button)
      break
    case 'touchEvent':
      console.log(event.numberOfTouches)
      break
    case 'keyboardEvent':
      console.log(event.key)
      break
  }
}\n
handleEvent({ type: 'mouseEvent', button: 'right' })`}
/>

### Enums

TypeScript supports enums, but unions are much more common:

- Enums can't have associated data
- Enums can't have methods or static members
- Converting to/from an enum is a hassle

<Example
  title="Enums"
  preset="typescript"
  width={0}
  code={`enum MyEnum {
  foo = 'foo',
  bar = 'bar'
}\n
// Not allowed!
// let e: MyEnum = 'foo'`}
/>

## Intersection types

This works both with object types and interfaces.

<Example
  title="Intersection types"
  preset="typescript"
  width={0}
  code={`type A = { foo: string }
type B = { bar: number }
type C = A & B\n
let c = { foo: "hello", bar: 42 }`}
/>
