Most of the time, we use mutable objects and arrays, but we often want to treat them as if they were immutable - instead of mutating them, we make a clone and modify the clone.

We typically do this through "spread" syntax:

See: https://www.typescript.express/syntax/spread

We sometimes do this for deeply nested objects, cloning each intermediate object/array.
